Reminder: Typescript was selected by the working group only as a syntax for representing the data model (entities, names, types, etc.).
The implementation language can be anything.

This proposal happens to choose Typescript as the implementation prototype's language.

## Running Unit Tests for This Typescript Prototype

### One Time Setup

* Install NPM (Node Package Manager)
* Then run `npm install` in the directory of code for Node + JS/TypeScript

### Run Tests

`npm run lint` runs the linter

`npm test` runs all tests

`npm run test` runs tests in the folder `test`
